# algorithm-visualization
This is an application to visualize and explore path finding algorithms on
a 2D grid. This application was built to get more familiar with SDL2 and 
learn more about C++.

# Implemented Algorithms
The application is able to execute the following path finding
algorithms on a 2D grid:
    - Dijkstra
    - A*
    - BFS

# Development environment

## Software
    - Linux Ubuntu 23.10
    - CMake 3.27.4 
    - g++ 13.2.0 

## Hardware
    - Microsoft Laptop Studio
    - 11th Gen Intel Core i7

# Guide
This is a quick guid on how to edit the 2D grid, select start 
and end node, select an algorithms and execute the algorithm.

## Edit the grid

Press i to enter edit mode
In edit mode presse e to make the end node at location of the cursor.
In edit mode press s to declare a starting point at the location of the cursor.
In edit mode click or drag the mouse with left mouse button to draw obstacles.
